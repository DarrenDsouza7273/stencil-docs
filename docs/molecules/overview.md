A `molecule` is a compound component made up of various atoms. It represents a more intricate UI element designed to fulfill a specific function within an application's interface. For example, a JSON to Table or an OTP (One-Time Password) Input Molecule, each composed of multiple atoms to provide a comprehensive and functional unit.

All molecules currently supported can be viewed on this [website](https://stencil-ui-templates.vercel.app/).
 
## Usage

By encapsulating common UI patterns within a configurable molecule component, you can easily reuse it throughout your application. Instead of duplicating similar components with minor variations, you can simply import and configure the molecule component as needed.
