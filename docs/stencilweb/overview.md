A `Stencil Web` is a libraray made up of various molecules and pages. It represents a more intricate UI element designed to fulfill a specific function within an application's interface. For example, a JSON to Table or an OTP (One-Time Password) Input Molecule, each composed of multiple atoms to provide a comprehensive and functional unit. Similarly, Otp Page, Login Page, and other pages provide complete interfaces for common application needs.

All molecules and pages currently supported can be viewed on this [website](https://stencil-ui-templates.vercel.app/).

## Usage

By encapsulating common UI patterns within a configurable page or molecule component, you can easily reuse it throughout your application. Instead of duplicating similar components with minor variations, you can simply import and configure the molecule component as needed.
